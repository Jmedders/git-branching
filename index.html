      <p><strong>Earth Day</strong> is an annual event, celebrated on April 22, on which day events worldwide are held to demonstrate support for environmental protection. It was first celebrated in 1970, and is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network and celebrated in more than 193 countries each year</p>
      <h3>More importantly, Earth Day is Lizzie's birthday</h3>
      <p>If you're looking for a way to celebrate Earth Day most people suggest planting a tree.  Better yet, plant a dozen trees. Plant a whole forest, nobody will stop you.</p>
      <p>On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement is scheduled to be signed by the United States, China, and some 120 other countries. This signing satisfies a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris</p>
